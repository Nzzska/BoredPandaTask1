# BoredPandaTask1

I can't exactly say, this is a complete project because initially, I planned to turn the script in this notebook into python script which runs once in 24 hours. 
Then use google sheets API to transfer the table to google sheets. Lastly, I task was a little unclear, but I tried to keep an open mind and do what I think would be useful.

Some quick points:

- One of the revenue columns were in USD, others in EUR, so I converted all USD values to be able to compare figures. (Used API so I'd get fresh rates every time) 
- Data was cleared, unnecessary symbols like '$' or 'O' instead of '0' was removed.  
- All information I thought was relevant combined in one large table (DataFrame)
- I created 2 graphs, however by having all relevent information in a DataFrame, I could easily graph anything else.
